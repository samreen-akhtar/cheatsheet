BASIC SYNTAX
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;
     // main() is where program execution begins.
     int main() {
     // This is where you write your code
     return 0;}
     
OUTPUT
     cout<<
INPUT
     cin>>
COMMENT
     //single line
     /*multi line*/
     
SWITCH
     A switch statement allows you to test an expression against a variety of cases. 
     If a match is found, the code within begins to run. A case can be ended with the break keyword. When no case matches, default is used.
     
     switch (grade) {
     case 9:
      cout << "Freshman\n";break;
     case 10:
      cout << "Sophomore\n";break;
     case 11:
      cout << "Junior\n";break;
     case 12:
      cout << "Senior\n";break;
     default:
      cout << "Invalid\n";break;}
      
ARRAYS
     Instead of defining individual variables for each item, arrays are used to hold these values of the same data type in a single variable.
     It stores the values in a contagious block of memory, thatâ€™s why we need to specify the number of values it is going to hold beforehand.

VECTORS
     A vector in C++ is a dynamic list of things that can expand and shrink in size. It can only hold values of the same type. 
     It is important to #include the vector library in order to use vectors.
     
     push_back() function adds the value at the end of the vector.
     pop_back() function removes the element from the end of the vector.
     size() returns the size of the vector.

FUNCTIONS
     When a function is called, it is a collection of statements that are all executed at the same time. 
     Every function has a name that is used to refer to it when it is called. A function typically contains the following parts:

     Return value: Return value is the value that the function return at the end of the function. 
                    A function must return the value of the same data type as mentioned in the function declaration.
     Parameters: The parameters are the placeholders of the values passed on to them. In the above code, a and b are the function parameters.
     Declaration: It contains the name of the function, its return type, and parameter list.

CLASS
     class City {
         // Attribute
     string name;
     int population;
     public:
        // Method
     void increase_population() {
         population++;
        }  };
        
        In C++, a class is the fundamental building block of Object-Oriented programming. A class typically consists of:

              Attributes, often called member data, are data about a specific instance of a class.
              Member functions, often known as methods, are functions that are present in the class.

OBJECT
      City Mumbai;
       An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates its data and member functions. The above code creates an instance of the class City named Mumbai.


FILE HANDLING
      int main() {
          // Create and open a text file
      ofstream MyFile("filename.txt");
          // Write to the file
      MyFile << "File Handling in C++";
          // Close the file
      MyFile.close();
      }
     
     File handling refers to reading and writing data in files. C++ provides us with functions that allow us to do so. The above code creates a file and writes text in it.

          getline();
    The above function allows us to read the file line by line.

          void open(const char* file_name,ios::openmode mode);
    The above function opens a file.
